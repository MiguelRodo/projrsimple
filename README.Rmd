The goal of projrsimple is to make it easy to run a clean project workflow.

It helps you initialise a reproducible project structure with pre‐defined
directories, run analysis scripts, and ensure clean output directories
with minimal effort.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `projrsimple` like so:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("MiguelRodo/projrsimple")
```

## TL;DR

1. Install `projrsimple` (see above).
2. Open an R session in your project directory (folder where you want to work).
3. Run `projr_init()` to initialise your project.
4. Write code in scripts (`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd` and/or Quarto projects) in the project directory.
5. Run `projr_run` to execute all scripts. Save outputs to `_output` directory.
6. View rendered documents in the `docs` directory.

To connect to GitHub automatically, run `projr_init(init_github = TRUE)` (step 3) *after* the following steps:

1. Create a GitHub account ([link](https://www.github.com)).
2. Set up a personal access token (PAT) in R ([instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat#tldr)).

## Details

### Project Initialisation with `projr_init`

The function `projr_init` is designed to help you quickly set up a standard project  
structure. It will (all of these features are optional):

- **Create Standard Directories:**  

  By default, it creates directories for:
  - Raw data: `_raw_data`
  - Temporary/cache files: `_tmp`
  - Rendered documents: `docs`
  - Final outputs: `_output`
  - Raw (non‐rendered) docs: `_reference`
  
  All of these directory names are fully customizable by supplying your own values  
  (or you can set any to `NULL` if you don’t want that directory).

- **Initialise a Git Repository:**  

  If you choose, `projr_init` can initialise a Git repository in your project.
  It will automatically add the  cache directory (by default `_tmp`) to your
  `.gitignore` to avoid committing  
  temporary files, and (if enabled) will add and commit any changes.  
  *Note:* To push your repository to GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub account and must  
  ensure that R is configured with your personal access token (PAT).

- **Create a README File:**  

  A default README is created with instructions on how to run your analyses,  
  reproduce the results, and a description of the directory structure. You can  
  customise or remove this by setting the corresponding parameter to `FALSE`.

- **Connect to GitHub (Optional):**

  If desired, you can instruct `projr_init` to connect your local Git repository  
  to GitHub (using `usethis::use_github()`). The repository can be created as private  
  by default, with a message reminding you that you must add collaborators manually  
  via GitHub’s settings.

### Running Analyses with `projr_run`

After you have initialised your project, you can use `projr_run` to execute your  
analyses. By default:

- **Script Detection and Execution:**  

  All scripts in your working directory with extensions `.R`, `.Rmd`/`.rmd`, and  
  `.qmd` are run automatically. In the presence of a Quarto project (a file named  
  `_quarto.yml`), individual `.qmd` files may be skipped in favour of running the  
  project as a whole.

- **Copying Generated Documents:**  

  The function will copy any generated documents (typically `.html`, `.pdf`, or  
  `.docx`) to the `docs` directory. This behavior is optional.

- **Output Directory Management:**  

  Optionally, the output directory (by default `_output`) is cleared before running  
  all the scripts.

- **Selective Execution:**  

  If you prefer, you can select which scripts to run by providing a character  
  vector of filenames. This enables you to run only a subset of your scripts.

### Multiple pipelines

For more advanced workflows, you can run `projr_run` multiple times to create  
separate "pipelines". For example, you might run one pipeline that processes raw data  
and another that generates reports, each using different script selections and  
output/document directories. This modular approach allows you to flexibly manage  
complex projects with multiple stages.
